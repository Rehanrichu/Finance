# Finance
ABOUT:-

Finance is a Flask-based web application that simulates a stock trading platform. Users can register for an account, receive $10,000 of virtual cash, and buy or sell stocks in real time using data from the IEX Cloud API. The platform provides a personal portfolio dashboard to track holdings, balances, and current market value. All transactions are stored in an SQLite database, allowing users to review their complete trading history.
This project demonstrates web development (Flask, Jinja, HTML, CSS), database management (SQLite, SQL), API integration, and user authentication & session management.
